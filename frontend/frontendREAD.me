Ticket Booking System – Frontend Application

This frontend application provides a responsive, user-centric interface for browsing shows, viewing seat layouts, and booking seats in real time. It is developed with React and Vite and communicates securely with the backend API.

1. Overview

The frontend serves as the user-facing layer of the Ticket Booking System. It is designed for clarity, speed, and ease of interaction. Users can navigate through available shows, explore seat availability, select seats, and monitor the status of their bookings.

The application is tightly integrated with the backend through RESTful API calls, and it is deployed on Vercel for scalable, globally distributed access.

2. Technology Stack

React

Vite

JavaScript or TypeScript (if applied)

Context API for state management

Vercel for deployment

Backend communication via REST APIs

4. Features
User Interface and Interaction

Display of show or trip listings.

Seat selection with visual mapping.

Real-time updates on booking status.

Clear error and loading states.

State Management

Context API for global state.

Reusable utility functions for API interactions.

Backend Integration

All API calls directed to the deployed backend.

Environment-based API configuration through VITE_API_URL.

Performance

Fast development environment through Vite.

Optimized build output for production deployment.

5. Environment Variables

The frontend relies on the following environment variable:

Variable	Description
VITE_API_URL	Public URL of the deployed backend

This value must be configured in Vercel during deployment.

6. Deployment

The frontend is deployed on Vercel, which provides automatic builds and global distribution.

Deployment steps:

Import the GitHub repository into Vercel.

Set the root directory to the frontend folder.

Configure the environment variable VITE_API_URL to point to the backend.

Allow Vercel to build and deploy the application.

Vercel generates a public frontend URL that users can access from any device.

7. User Flow

Once deployed, users can:

Browse all shows or trips.

View seat availability in real time.

Select seats and initiate a booking.

Monitor booking status updates returned by the backend.

The UI is designed for clarity and responsiveness across screens.

8. Local Development Instructions

Navigate to the frontend directory.

Install all required dependencies.

Start the Vite development server.

Ensure the backend is running locally or deployed.

The frontend automatically connects to the backend using the configured API URL.

9. Design Principles

Component-based architecture

Clean separation of UI and logic

Use of reusable, maintainable code

Mobile-responsive layout

Predictable and testable behavior
